## :hammer: Build it yourself

Before developing the app, you need to fetch your own API tokens for the following services:

| Service                 | Url                                                                                 | Comments                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| World Air Quality Index | http://aqicn.org/api/                                                               | Required.                                               |
| LocationIQ              | https://locationiq.com/                                                             | Optional, but recommended for showing precise location. |
| Algolia Places          | https://community.algolia.com/places/rest.html (`Get Started` button on the bottom) | Optional, lower API rates if not provided.              |
| Google Maps for iOS     | https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start                      | Optional in development.                                |
| Google Maps for Android | https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/                       | Optional in development.                                |
| Sentry Bug Tracking     | https://sentry.io                                                                   | Optional.                                               |

Then run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amaurymartiny/shoot-i-smoke
cd shoot-i-smoke
yarn install

cp app.example.json app.json # Replace the API keys placeholders with your own tokens in app.json

yarn start
```

This app is created with Expo, using React Native. When you run `yarn start`, the Expo packager will show, and you can either:

- install the Expo app, scan the displayed QR code, and run the app on your mobile phone directly.
- open the Android simulator.
- open the iOS simulator.

All the code lives in the `App/` folder. The app itself is pretty small, so it should be fairly easy to navigate through the files.
